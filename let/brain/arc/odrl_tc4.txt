=== Pretty Proof ===

[1] Premise: ∀w. PermWithDuty(ex:alice, odrl:use, ex:resourceX, ex:signContract, ex:bob, ex:contract, w)  // Permission with attached duty holds in every world
[2] Duty-Induces-Obligation [1]: PermWithDuty(…, ex:alice, ex:signContract, ex:bob, ex:contract, w) ⇒ Obl(ex:alice, ex:signContract, ex:bob, ex:contract, w)  // To exercise the permission, the duty must be fulfilled
[3] Derive-Universal [2]: ∀w. Obl(ex:alice, ex:signContract, ex:bob, ex:contract, w)  // Obligation on the duty induced by the permission-with-duty
[4] Premise: ∀w. Proh(ex:alice, ex:signContract, ex:bob, ex:contract, w)  // Unconditional Prohibition on the duty action
[5] Universe-Def: W := all possible worlds  // No external conditions restrict applicability
[6] Arbitrary-World [5]: w0 ∈ W (arbitrary)  // World chosen arbitrarily; argument must not depend on which one
[7] Universal-Elim [3, 6]: Obl(ex:alice, ex:signContract, ex:bob, ex:contract, w0)  // Instantiate the induced obligation on the duty at w0
[8] Deontic-Axiom: O(a) ⇒ P(a)  // From obligation, permission follows (O⇒P)
[9] Deontic-Apply [8, 7]: Perm(ex:alice, ex:signContract, ex:bob, ex:contract, w0)  // Apply O⇒P at w0
[10] Universal-Elim [4, 6]: Proh(ex:alice, ex:signContract, ex:bob, ex:contract, w0)  // Instantiate the prohibition on the duty at w0
[11] And-Intro [9, 10]: (Perm(ex:alice, ex:signContract, ex:bob, ex:contract, w0) ∧ Proh(ex:alice, ex:signContract, ex:bob, ex:contract, w0))  // Clash at the arbitrary world on the duty action
[12] ForAll-Intro [11]: ∀w. (Perm(ex:alice, ex:signContract, ex:bob, ex:contract, w0) ∧ Proh(ex:alice, ex:signContract, ex:bob, ex:contract, w))  // Since w0 was arbitrary, the clash holds in all worlds
[13] Classification [12]: Global activation state = https://w3id.org/force/compliance-report#Conflict  // The duty is simultaneously (Perm|Obl) and Proh in every world
