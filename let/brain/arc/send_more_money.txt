Solution (deterministic, pure Python):
  D = 7
  E = 5
  M = 1
  N = 6
  O = 0
  R = 8
  S = 9
  Y = 2

SEND  = 9567
MORE  = 1085
MONEY = 10652

Verified: 9567 + 1085 = 10652 == 10652

Proof (explaining the logic):
  Each letter was assigned a unique digit.
  None of the numbers start with zero (S = 9, M = 1).
  Final equation: 9567 (SEND) + 1085 (MORE) = 10652 (MONEY) is satisfied.
  No digit is reused, and all conditions are respected.
