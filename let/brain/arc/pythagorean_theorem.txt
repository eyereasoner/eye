Pythagorean Theorem — Proof via Similarity
============================================

Setup:
We have a right triangle ABC with right angle at C.
Legs: AC = b, BC = a   |   Hypotenuse: AB = c

Step 1 — Drop an altitude:
From point C, draw an altitude to AB, meeting it at D.
This splits AB into two segments: AD = p and DB = q, with p + q = c.

Step 2 — Similar triangles (AA):
ΔACD ~ ΔABC (share angle A, both right-angled).
ΔCBD ~ ΔABC (share angle B, both right-angled).
Therefore ΔACD ~ ΔCBD as well.

Step 3 — Read ratios from similarity:
At angle A:  p / b = b / c   ⇒   b² = c·p   ⇒   p = b² / c
At angle B:  q / a = a / c   ⇒   a² = c·q   ⇒   q = a² / c

Step 4 — Put the pieces together:
Partition: p + q = c.
Add the two equalities: a² + b² = c·p + c·q = c·(p + q) = c².

Step 5 — Altitude and geometric mean (supporting facts):
Altitude length: h = (a b) / c (areas ½ab and ½ch must match).
Geometric-mean relation: h² = p·q (follows from ΔACD ~ ΔCBD).

Conclusion:
The square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the legs.
