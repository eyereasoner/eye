============================================
The Liar — outer limits of reason (classical logic)
============================================

Sentence:
  L := "This sentence is false."
Naïve classical schema:
  L ≡ ¬L

Reason why it goes off the rails:
  • Assume L is True  ⇒  ¬L is False  ⇒  L is False.  (Contradiction)
  • Assume L is False ⇒  ¬L is True   ⇒  L is True.   (Contradiction)
  No consistent truth value exists under these assumptions.

Philosophical upshot (without changing the system):
  We can frankly admit the paradox marks an 'outer limit of reason' *for this setup*—
  a place where our ordinary, two-valued, self-referential talk breaks itself.

Check (classical two-valued):
  ✓ No satisfying assignment exists for L ≡ ¬L. (Unsatisfiable)

Conclusion:
  In plain classical logic, the liar forces contradiction either way—
  a precise, technical sense in which it lives at the 'outer limits of reason.' □
