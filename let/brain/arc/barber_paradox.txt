============================================
The Barber Paradox — outer limits of reason
============================================

Setup:
  Predicate S(x,y): 'x shaves y'. Let b be the barber.
  Barber condition:  ∀y [ S(b,y) ↔ ¬S(y,y) ]

Key instance (y := b):
  S(b,b) ↔ ¬S(b,b)

Reason why it contradicts classical logic:
  • If S(b,b) is True, then ¬S(b,b) is True — impossible.
  • If S(b,b) is False, then ¬S(b,b) is True, so S(b,b) must be True — impossible.
  No classical assignment satisfies S(b,b) ↔ ¬S(b,b).

Philosophical upshot:
  Without changing the rules, this definition self-destructs;
  it marks an 'outer limit of reason' for plain two-valued self-reference.

Check (classical two-valued):
  ✓ Unsatisfiable: no truth value p makes p ↔ ¬p hold.

Conclusion:
  The barber condition forces p ↔ ¬p at p = S(b,b), so there’s no classical model.
  That’s precisely how the paradox lives at the 'outer limits of reason.' □
