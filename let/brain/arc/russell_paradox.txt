Russell’s Paradox — outer limits of naïve comprehension
============================================

Setup:
  R := { x | x ∉ x }   (the set of all sets that do not contain themselves)
Question:
  Is R ∈ R ?  (abbreviate r := 'R ∈ R')

Reason why it explodes in classical logic:
  • If r is True (R ∈ R), then by definition of R, R ∉ R — contradiction.
  • If r is False (R ∉ R), then R meets its own membership condition, so R ∈ R — contradiction.
  Therefore r ≡ ¬r has no classical solution.

Philosophical upshot:
  Naïve comprehension overreaches; restricting it (as in ZF/ZFC) avoids the paradox.
  Without such restrictions, this is an 'outer limit of reason' for the system.

Check (classical two-valued):
  ✓ Unsatisfiable: no truth value r makes r ≡ ¬r hold.

Conclusion:
  Russell’s construction forces r ≡ ¬r under naïve comprehension,
  so classical consistency fails — a precise 'outer limit of reason.' □
