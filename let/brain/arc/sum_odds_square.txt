Induction Example — Sum of first n odds = n^2
============================================

Claim:
  For every n ≥ 1,  1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n−1) = n².

Proof (by induction on n):
  Base case (n=1):
    Left side = 1,  Right side = 1² = 1.  True.

  Inductive step:
    Assume for some n ≥ 1 that  1 + 3 + ... + (2n−1) = n².  (Induction hypothesis)
    Then for n+1 we have:
      1 + 3 + ... + (2n−1) + (2(n+1)−1)
      = n² + (2n + 1)                 (by the hypothesis)
      = (n + 1)².                     (algebra)
    So the statement holds for n+1.  By induction, it holds for all n ≥ 1.  □

Geometric intuition (why it *feels* true):
  Arrange dots as an n×n square (n² dots). To grow to (n+1)²,
  you add an L-shaped border of exactly 2n+1 dots — the next odd number.
  Repeating this from 1² adds 1, then 3, then 5, ... building perfect squares at each step.
