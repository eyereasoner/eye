Nixon Diamond with Priorities — explain and check
============================================

Hard facts:
  Q := Quaker(n),  R := Republican(n)
Defaults:
  δ1: Q : D      (normally, Quakers are Doves)
  δ2: R : H      (normally, Republicans are Hawks)
Constraint:
  not (D and H)

Priority idea:
  When two applicable defaults would conflict, prefer the higher-priority one and
  block the lower-priority conclusion if it would violate the constraint.

Case A — Prioritize δ1 over δ2 (Quaker-default outranks Republican-default):
  Facts give Q and R, so both defaults are applicable in principle.
  Apply δ1 first ⇒ conclude D. Now δ2 would add H, but (D ∧ H) is forbidden,
  so δ2 is blocked. Unique prioritized extension: {Q, R, D}.

Case B — Prioritize δ2 over δ1 (Republican-default outranks Quaker-default):
  Apply δ2 first ⇒ conclude H. Now δ1 would add D, but (D ∧ H) is forbidden,
  so δ1 is blocked. Unique prioritized extension: {Q, R, H}.

Conclusion:
  Priorities collapse the two competing default conclusions into a single outcome.
  With δ1>δ2 we get Dove; with δ2>δ1 we get Hawk. □

Computed prioritized extensions:
  With δ1>δ2: ['D', 'Q', 'R']
  With δ2>δ1: ['H', 'Q', 'R']

Harness:
  • Priorities δ1>δ2 ⇒ {Q,R,D} (Dove).
  • Priorities δ2>δ1 ⇒ {Q,R,H} (Hawk).
  • Both extensions consistent; facts preserved. ✓
