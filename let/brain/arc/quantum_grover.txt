Case 1
======
Answer:
  Oracle on |10> → −|10>

Reason why:
  The oracle flips the phase of the marked basis state and acts as identity on others.

Check (harness):
  ‖state‖² = 1.000000000000 (should be 1)
  amplitude[|10>] = -1.0 (should be −1)

Case 2
======
Answer:
  Oracle on |11> (unmarked) → |11>

Reason why:
  The oracle only flips the marked ket; all unmarked basis states are fixed.

Check (harness):
  identical? True

Case 3
======
Answer:
  One Grover iteration from |s> (n=2) → |10>  (i.e., |10>)

Reason why:
  For N=4, θ = arcsin(1/√N) = 30°. After one iteration the success prob is sin²(3θ)=1,
  so the state becomes exactly the marked basis state.

Check (harness):
  ‖state‖² = 1.000000000000 (should be 1)
  equals |10> exactly? True

Case 4
======
Answer:
  One Grover iteration from |s> (n=4, N=16).
  Marked amplitude   = 0.687500  (expected 11/16 = 0.687500)
  Unmarked amplitude = 0.187500  (expected  3/16 = 0.187500)
  (All unmarked amplitudes are equal.)

Reason why:
  After oracle the mean amplitude is μ=(N−2)/(N√N). Diffusion reflects every amplitude
  about μ, yielding a'_m=(3N−4)/(N√N)=11/16 and a'_(other)=(N−4)/(N√N)=3/16 for N=16.

Check (harness):
  ‖state‖² = 1.000000000000 (should be 1)
  all unmarked equal? True
  a_marked  ≈ theory? True  (num=0.687500000000, th=0.687500000000)
  a_unmarked≈ theory? True  (num=0.187500000000, th=0.187500000000)
  diffusion = reflection about mean? True
