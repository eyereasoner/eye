Why arcsin(2) is complex — the 'reason why'
============================================

1) For any real y, -1 ≤ sin(y) ≤ 1.
   So sin(y) = 2 has no real solution — arcsin(2) cannot be real.

2) In complex analysis, arcsin is defined as:
     arcsin(z) = -i · ln( i z + sqrt(1 - z²) )

3) For z = 2 (real), we have 1 - z² = 1 - 4 = -3 < 0.
   So sqrt(1 - z²) = i·sqrt(3), which is purely imaginary.
   This makes the argument of ln complex, hence arcsin(2) is complex.

4) In fact, for any real x > 1:
     arcsin(x) = π/2 - i · ln( x + sqrt(x² - 1) )
   which has nonzero imaginary part.

Conclusion:
   arcsin(2) is complex (has a nonzero imaginary part).

Proof harness passed for x = 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, 10.0: all non-real arcsin(x) confirmed.
