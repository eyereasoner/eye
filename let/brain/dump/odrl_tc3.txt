--- Goal-Oriented Proof Explanation ---

Policies:
  (O1) Obligation:  ex:alice must odrl:read ex:resourceX.
  (F1) Prohibition: ex:alice must-not odrl:read ex:resourceX.
  Both rules are unconditional (no constraints/refinements).

Derivation:
  (S1) Because (O1) is unconditional, for any world w, O(read) holds in w.
  (S2) Because (F1) is unconditional, for any world w, F(read) holds in w.
  (C) For arbitrary w, O(read) ∧ F(read). Since w was arbitrary,
      this holds for all worlds. Therefore the policies conflict in every
      possible state of the world ⇒ Global state: Conflict.

Optional deontic note:
  From O(read) we may infer P(read). Hence P(read) ∧ F(read) also holds in all worlds,
  matching the testcase phrasing “permit and prohibit … for any possible state of the world.”
