--- Goal-Oriented Proof Explanation ---

Policies:
  (P1) Permission with duty: ex:alice may odrl:use ex:resourceX
       provided she fulfills duty D: ex:signContract (assigner ex:bob, target ex:contract).
  (F1) Prohibition: ex:alice must-not ex:signContract ex:contract (assigner ex:bob).

Deontic reading of duties:
  (D) A duty attached to a permission induces an obligation to perform the duty action
      for the same subject/assigner/target when exercising the permission.

Derivation:
  (S1) From (P1) and (D): Obligation O(ex:signContract on ex:contract, assigner ex:bob) holds for ex:alice.
  (S2) From (F1): Prohibition F(ex:signContract on ex:contract, assigner ex:bob) holds for ex:alice.
  (S3) O and F refer to the *same* action/assignee/assigner/target.
  (C) Therefore, for any world w, O(signContract) ∧ F(signContract) holds ⇒ Global state: Conflict.

Intuition:
  The permission can only be exercised by fulfilling the duty (signing),
  yet signing is prohibited. The system simultaneously requires and forbids the very same act.
