WHY THE FORMULA IS TRUE (concise geometric reasoning):
1) In a regular n-gon inscribed in a circle, each side is a chord.
2) Two radii to adjacent vertices + the side form an isosceles triangle with central angle θ = 2π/n.
3) Bisect the triangle: you get a right triangle with hypotenuse r, opposite leg s/2, angle θ/2.
   Hence sin(θ/2) = (s/2)/r  =>  s = 2 r sin(θ/2).

For n = 12, r = 1.0:  θ = 2π/n = 0.523598775598 rad, so s = 2 * 1.0 * sin(θ/2) with θ/2 = 0.261799387799 rad.

NUMERICAL EVALUATION (Taylor series sine, no imports):
  s ≈ 0.517638090205

CLOSED-FORM EVALUATION (angle subtraction: sin(45°-30°)):
  sin(15°) = (√6 - √2) / 4  ⇒  s = 2 sin(15°) = (√6 - √2) / 2
  s = (sqrt(6) - sqrt(2)) / 2 ≈ 0.517638090205

Both approaches agree (within tiny numerical error).
