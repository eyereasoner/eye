--- Goal-Oriented Proof Explanation ---

Policies:
  (P1) Permission:  ex:alice may odrl:read ex:collectionX.
  (F1) Prohibition: ex:alice must-not odrl:read ex:collectionY.
  Both rules are unconditional (no constraints/refinements).

Asset facts and overlap:
  Members(X) = ['ex:document1', 'ex:document2']
  Members(Y) = ['ex:document1', 'ex:document2', 'ex:document3']
  Overlap X ∩ Y = ['ex:document1', 'ex:document2']

Collection lifting:
  (L1) If Perm(act, C) and partOf(a, C), then Perm(act, a).
  (L2) If Proh(act, C) and partOf(a, C), then Proh(act, a).

Witness construction:
  Choose a := ex:document1 ∈ X ∩ Y.
  From (P1) and (L1): Perm(read, a).
  From (F1) and (L2): Proh(read, a).
  Therefore Perm(read, a) ∧ Proh(read, a) holds.

Conclusion:
  Since both rules are unconditional and the overlap is factual,
  the clash persists in every possible world ⇒ Global state: Conflict.
