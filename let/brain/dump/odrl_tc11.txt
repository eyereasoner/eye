--- Goal-Oriented Proof Explanation ---

Goal G: ∃a  (Perm(pay,a) ∧ Prohib(pay,a))  for the same subject, action, and target.

Policy facts:
  (P1) Permission: pay > 10.00 Euro  (policy11a).
  (P2) Obligation: pay < 10.00 Euro  (policy11b).

Deontic axiom (used as a rule):
  (D) From O(pay < 10.00 Euro) infer F(pay > 10.00 Euro).

Subgoals and derivation:
  (S1) From (P2) and (D) derive Prohib(pay > 10.00 Euro).
  (S2) Choose witness amount a := 10.01 Euro with a > 10.00 (witness is in the overlap).
  (S3) From (P1) and a > 10.00, derive Perm(pay,a).
  (S4) From (S1) and a > 10.00, derive Prohib(pay,a).
  (C) From (S3) and (S4), Perm(pay,a) ∧ Prohib(pay,a). Therefore ∃a … holds.
Conclusion: Goal G is satisfied ⇒ Conflict.
