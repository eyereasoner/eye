--- Goal-Oriented Proof Explanation ---

Policies:
  (P1) Permission:  ex:alice may odrl:read ex:resourceX
       when ex:age == 18.
  (F1) Prohibition: ex:alice must-not odrl:read ex:resourceX
       when ex:age == 18.

Precondition analysis:
  The constraints are identical, so their intersection is the singleton set {ex:age = 18}.

Witness construction:
  Choose world w := (age=18). Then (P1) holds in w and (F1) holds in w.

Derivation:
  (S1) In w, Permission(odrl:read) holds (by P1).
  (S2) In w, Prohibition(odrl:read) holds (by F1).
  (C) Therefore, in every world that satisfies both policies’ preconditions
      (i.e., the intersection {w}), Perm ∧ Prohib holds ⇒ Global state: Conflict.
