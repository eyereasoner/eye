The irrationality of e — a clean proof
============================================

1) Start from the series definition:
   e = 1 + 1 + 1/2! + 1/3! + 1/4! + ... = sum_{n=0}^∞ 1/n!

2) Assume for contradiction that e is rational: e = a/b (a, b ∈ ℕ, b ≥ 1).
   Let N = b. Split e into a partial sum S_N and a positive tail R_N where
     S_N = sum_{n=0}^N 1/n!
     R_N = sum_{n=N+1}^∞ 1/n!

3) Multiply by N! (here N = b):
     N! · e = N! · S_N + N! · R_N
   For 0 ≤ n ≤ N, each N!/n! is an integer (n! divides N!).
   Hence N! · S_N is an integer.

4) Bound the scaled tail:
     N! · R_N = sum_{n=N+1}^∞ N!/n! = sum_{k=1}^∞ 1 / ∏_{j=1}^k (N+j).
   Since every factor (N+j) ≥ (N+1), we have termwise
     1 / [(N+1)(N+2)...(N+k)]  <  1 / (N+1)^k  for k ≥ 2 (with equality at k=1).
   Therefore the whole tail is strictly less than the geometric series
     1/(N+1) + 1/(N+1)^2 + ...  =  1/N,
   i.e.  0 < N!·R_N < 1/N < 1  for all N ≥ 2.

5) Contradiction for a hypothetical rational e = a/b:
   With N = b, we have  N!·e = b!·e = a·(b−1)!  (an integer).
   But also  N!·e = [integer] + (N!·R_N)  with  0 < N!·R_N < 1.
   An integer plus a strictly between-0-and-1 amount cannot be an integer.
   Contradiction. Therefore, e is irrational.  □

All harness checks passed (N = 2..12, M = 6):
• Divisibility of N!/n! for 0 ≤ n ≤ N
• Strict per-term bounds vs geometric series
• Concrete rational upper bound U_M < 1 and < 1/N
