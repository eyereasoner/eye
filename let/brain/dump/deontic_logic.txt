=== Proving violation ===
World 1: light=red   action=stop  ✗ violation (light=red ⇒ ought(stop); action=stop = stop ⇒ no violation)
World 2: light=red   action=go    ✓ violation (light=red ⇒ ought(stop); action=go ≠ stop ⇒ violation)
World 3: light=green action=stop  ✓ violation (light=green ⇒ ought(go); action=stop ≠ go ⇒ violation)
World 4: light=green action=go    ✗ violation (light=green ⇒ ought(go); action=go = go ⇒ no violation)
Result: SATISFIABLE (but not valid) — holds in 2/4 worlds.

=== Proving light(red) ===
World 1: light=red   action=stop  ✓ light(red) (world has light=red)
World 2: light=red   action=go    ✓ light(red) (world has light=red)
World 3: light=green action=stop  ✗ light(red) (world has light=green)
World 4: light=green action=go    ✗ light(red) (world has light=green)
Result: SATISFIABLE (but not valid) — holds in 2/4 worlds.

=== Proving light(green) ===
World 1: light=red   action=stop  ✗ light(green) (world has light=red)
World 2: light=red   action=go    ✗ light(green) (world has light=red)
World 3: light=green action=stop  ✓ light(green) (world has light=green)
World 4: light=green action=go    ✓ light(green) (world has light=green)
Result: SATISFIABLE (but not valid) — holds in 2/4 worlds.

=== Proving action(stop) ===
World 1: light=red   action=stop  ✓ action(stop) (world has action=stop)
World 2: light=red   action=go    ✗ action(stop) (world has action=go)
World 3: light=green action=stop  ✓ action(stop) (world has action=stop)
World 4: light=green action=go    ✗ action(stop) (world has action=go)
Result: SATISFIABLE (but not valid) — holds in 2/4 worlds.

=== Proving action(go) ===
World 1: light=red   action=stop  ✗ action(go) (world has action=stop)
World 2: light=red   action=go    ✓ action(go) (world has action=go)
World 3: light=green action=stop  ✗ action(go) (world has action=stop)
World 4: light=green action=go    ✓ action(go) (world has action=go)
Result: SATISFIABLE (but not valid) — holds in 2/4 worlds.
