Answer:
  none      → fidelity = 1.000000
  X on q0   → fidelity = 1.000000
  X on q1   → fidelity = 1.000000
  X on q2   → fidelity = 1.000000

Reason why:
  Encode by copying the data qubit to two ancillae: |ψ̄⟩ = α|000⟩+β|111⟩.
  A single X flips one physical bit and flips the signs of stabilizers that
  touch it. Measuring S₁=Z₀Z₁ and S₂=Z₁Z₂ yields a unique ±1 pair that
  pinpoints the flipped qubit (see syndrome table above). Applying that X
  restores |ψ̄⟩, and inverse CNOTs decode back to |ψ⟩, so the final fidelity
  with the original is 1 (up to rounding).

Check (harness):
  Test state            : |ψ⟩ = 0.397148|0⟩ + 0.917755|1⟩
  |||ψ̄⟩||² before errors = 1.000000000000 (should be 1)
