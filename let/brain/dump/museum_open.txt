============================================
Disjunction Elimination — realistic, exhaustive example
============================================

Propositions:
  Wd: Today is a weekday
  We: Today is a weekend
  Op: The museum is open today

Premises:
  (P1) Wd ∨ We            # exhaustive: it’s either weekday or weekend
  (P2) Wd → Op            # if weekday, open
  (P3) We → Op            # if weekend, open

Derivation (proof by cases):
  From (P1), exactly one of Wd or We holds (mutually exclusive & exhaustive).
   • Case Weekday: assume Wd.  From (P2), infer Op.
   • Case Weekend: assume We.  From (P3), infer Op.
  Since both cases yield Op, conclude Op.   (∨-Elim)

Conclusion:
  (C) Op — The museum is open today.

Harness: scanned 4 exhaustive/exclusive day-cases; 2 satisfy (P1)&(P2)&(P3).
All satisfying cases make Op True.  ∨-Elimination validated on a realistic, exhaustive split. ✓
