--- Goal-Oriented Proof Explanation ---

Policies:
  (P1) Permission to read if recipient is a student.
  (P2) Permission to read if recipient is an employee.
  (F1) Prohibition to read if recipient is both a student AND an employee.

World evaluation (Student, Employee) ↦ {Perm, Prohib, Conflict}:
  (Student=F, Employee=F): Perm=False, Prohib=False, Conflict=False
  (Student=T, Employee=F): Perm=True, Prohib=False, Conflict=False
  (Student=F, Employee=T): Perm=True, Prohib=False, Conflict=False
  (Student=T, Employee=T): Perm=True, Prohib=True, Conflict=True

Witness construction:
  (W1) Permitted world: (Student=T, Employee=F)  — satisfies P1 ∨ P2.
  (W2) Prohibited world: (Student=T, Employee=T) — satisfies F1 (student ∧ employee).
  (W3) Conflict world exists: (Student=T, Employee=T) — both permitted and prohibited here.
  (W4) Neutral world exists: (Student=F, Employee=F) — neither permitted nor prohibited.

Derivation:
  (S1) ∃ world with Prohib(read): witness W2.
  (S2) ∃ world with Perm(read): witness W1.
  (S3) Not all worlds are conflicts (e.g., W1 is pure-permitted or W4 is neutral).
  (C) Since some worlds permit and some worlds prohibit, but not all are conflicts,
      the global activation state is Ambiguous.
