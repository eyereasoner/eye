--- Goal-Oriented Proof Explanation ---

Policies:
  (P1) Permission:  ex:alice may ex:rent ex:collectionX.
  (P2) Permission:  ex:alice may ex:sell ex:collectionX.
  (F1) Prohibition: ex:alice must-not ex:rentsell ex:collectionX.
  All three rules are unconditional (no constraints/refinements).

Action axiom (intersection):
  (A) ex:rentsell ≡ ex:rent ⊓ ex:sell.

Derivation:
  (S1) From (P1) and (P2): Perm(ex:rent) ∧ Perm(ex:sell).
  (S2) From (A) and (S1): Perm(ex:rentsell) (permission on each component yields permission on their intersection).
  (S3) From (F1): Proh(ex:rentsell).
  (C) Therefore, in any world w, Perm(ex:rentsell) ∧ Proh(ex:rentsell).
      Since w was arbitrary and the rules are unconditional, the global state is Conflict.

Intuition ("drink & drive" analogy):
  Being allowed to do X and allowed to do Y, while being forbidden to do X AND Y together,
  creates a direct clash once the composite action X∧Y is recognized as an action in its own right.
