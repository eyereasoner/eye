--- Goal-Oriented Proof Explanation ---

Policies:
  (P1) Permission:  ex:alice may odrl:read ex:resourceX.
  (F1) Prohibition: ex:alice must-not odrl:read ex:resourceX.
  Both rules have no conditions/refinements (they are unconditional).

Derivation:
  (S1) Because (P1) is unconditional, for any world w, Perm(read) holds in w.
  (S2) Because (F1) is unconditional, for any world w, Prohib(read) holds in w.
  (C) For arbitrary w, Perm(read) ∧ Prohib(read). Since w was arbitrary,
      this holds for all worlds. Therefore the policies conflict in every
      possible state of the world ⇒ Global state: Conflict.
