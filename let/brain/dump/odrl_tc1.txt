=== Pretty Proof ===

[1] Premise: ∀w. Perm(ex:alice, odrl:read, ex:resourceX, w)  // Unconditional Permission: holds in every world
[2] Premise: ∀w. Proh(ex:alice, odrl:read, ex:resourceX, w)  // Unconditional Prohibition: holds in every world
[3] Universe-Def: W := all possible worlds  // No constraints/refinements restrict applicability
[4] Arbitrary-World [3]: w0 ∈ W (arbitrary)  // World chosen arbitrarily; proof must not depend on which one
[5] Universal-Elim [1, 4]: Perm(ex:alice, odrl:read, ex:resourceX, w0)  // Instantiate unconditional Permission at w0
[6] Universal-Elim [2, 4]: Proh(ex:alice, odrl:read, ex:resourceX, w0)  // Instantiate unconditional Prohibition at w0
[7] And-Intro [5, 6]: (Perm(ex:alice, odrl:read, ex:resourceX, w0) ∧ Proh(ex:alice, odrl:read, ex:resourceX, w0))  // Clash at the arbitrary world
[8] ForAll-Intro [7]: ∀w. (Perm(ex:alice, odrl:read, ex:resourceX, w) ∧ Proh(ex:alice, odrl:read, ex:resourceX, w))  // Since w0 was arbitrary, the conjunction holds in all worlds
[9] Classification [8]: Global activation state = https://w3id.org/force/compliance-report#Conflict  // Perm and Proh hold in every possible world
