--- Goal-Oriented Proof Explanation ---

Policies:
  (P1) Permission:  ex:alice may odrl:read ex:collectionX.
  (F1) Prohibition: ex:alice must-not odrl:read ex:document2.
  Both rules are unconditional (no constraints/refinements).

Asset structure:
  (A) ex:document2 is partOf ex:collectionX.
Collection lifting rule:
  (L) If Perm(act, C) and partOf(a, C), then Perm(act, a).

Derivation:
  (S1) From (P1), Perm(read, ex:collectionX).
  (S2) From (A) and (L), Perm(read, ex:document2).
  (S3) From (F1), Prohib(read, ex:document2).
  (C) Therefore, in any world w, Perm(read, ex:document2) ∧ Prohib(read, ex:document2).
      Since w was arbitrary, the policies conflict in every possible world ⇒ Global state: Conflict.
