--- Goal-Oriented Proof Explanation ---

Policies (activation windows over odrl:dateTime):
  (P1) Permission window : [2025-01-01, 2025-12-31]  (i.e., 2025-01-01 ≤ d ≤ 2025-12-31).
  (F1) Prohibition window: (-∞, 2026-01-01)  (i.e., d < 2026-01-01).

Overlap analysis:
  (I) Intersection = [2025-01-01, 2025-12-31] (this is exactly the entire year 2025).

Witness construction:
  Choose d := 2025-01-01 ∈ Intersection.
  From (P1): Perm(odrl:read, d).
  From (F1): Proh(odrl:read, d).

Conclusion:
  Since the overlap equals the whole permission window and both rules are unconditional
  beyond their date constraints, the clash holds for every day in 2025 ⇒ Global state: Conflict.
