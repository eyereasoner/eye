Explanation:
─────────────
A Hamiltonian path must:
  • Visit each vertex exactly once.
  • Traverse only along edges in the graph.
The algorithm checks all such paths using backtracking.
Each returned path satisfies these properties.
Therefore, the output is correct and complete under exhaustive search.
