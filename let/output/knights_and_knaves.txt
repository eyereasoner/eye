Solution (deterministic, pure Python):
  A is a Knight
  B is a Knave
  C is a Knave
  D is a Knight
  E is a Knight
  F is a Knight
  G is a Knave
  H is a Knight

Proof (explaining each statement logically):

A is a Knight and says: "B is a Knave."
  A is a Knight, and says B is a Knave → So B is a Knave

B is a Knave and says: "C is a Knight."
  B is a Knave, and says C is a Knight → So C is a Knave

C is a Knave and says: "D is a Knave."
  C is a Knave, and says D is a Knave → So D is a Knight

D is a Knight and says: "E and F are of the same type."
  D is a Knight, and says E and F are the same → E is Knight, F is Knight → same

E is a Knight and says: "G is a Knave."
  E is a Knight, and says G is a Knave → G is a Knave

F is a Knight and says: "I am a Knight."
  F is a Knight, and says they are a Knight → Statement is true

G is a Knave and says: "H is a Knave."
  G is a Knave, and says H is a Knave → H is a Knight

H is a Knight and says: "A is a Knight."
  H is a Knight, and says A is a Knight → A is a Knight
