Bell’s Spaceship Paradox — explain and check
============================================

Setup:
  • Two ships A (rear) and B (front) start at rest, separated by lab distance L.
  • Engines are synchronized in the lab; lab separation stays exactly L.
  • A thin, inelastic string of rest length L connects A to B.

Reason why the string breaks:
  • Consider A’s instantaneous rest frame S′ at some lab time t_A (speed v_A>0).
  • In S′, simultaneity slices tilt; the B-event simultaneous with A(t_A)
    occurs at a later lab time t_B > t_A. Using simultaneity (Δt = v_A Δx)
    and the convexity of accelerating worldlines, one shows L′(t_A) ≥ γ(t_A)·L,
    with strict '>' once v_A>0.
  • Since the string’s rest length is fixed at L, it cannot reach γ(t_A)L or more;
    tension grows and the string must break.  □

Parameters:  α=0.002,  L=100.0

Table: lab time t, lab speed v, gamma γ, lower bound γ·L, and computed L′ in S′ (A’s frame)
Note: With acceleration we expect   L′(t)  ≥  γ(t)·L   (strict for v>0).

Harness:
  • γ(t) is nondecreasing and > 1 for t > 0.
  • Lab-frame separation is exactly L at all times (by construction).
  • Computed comoving separation obeys  L′(t) ≥ γ(t)·L  (strict once v>0), and the
    simultaneous B-event indeed occurs at later lab time t_B > t_A. ✓
