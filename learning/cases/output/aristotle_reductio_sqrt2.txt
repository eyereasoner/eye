Conclusion: √2 is irrational (not a ratio of whole numbers).

========================================
Reason (Aristotelian apagogé / reductio)
========================================
Assume, for contradiction, that √2 = p/q in lowest terms (gcd(p,q)=1).
Then 2 = p²/q², so p² = 2·q². Thus p² is even, hence p is even (parity lemma).
Write p = 2k. Substituting, (2k)² = 2·q² ⇒ 4k² = 2·q² ⇒ q² = 2k², so q is even.
But then p and q are both even, contradicting the 'lowest terms' assumption.
Therefore the assumption is impossible; by the Principle of Non-Contradiction,
we reject it. Hence √2 is irrational.

[PASS] Parity lemma: n^2 even  ⇔  n even (tested on [-2000,2000])
[PASS] For 1 ≤ q ≤ 4999, 2·q^2 is never a perfect square
[PASS] No coprime p,q satisfy p^2 = 2 q^2 up to q ≤ 5000
[PASS] Convergents get close to √2 but (as rationals) never equal it
