Answer
------
Residual program (generated at mix time):
def barber_sentence_res(S: dict) -> bool:
    """Residual: truth of ∀x. Shaves(b,x) == (not Shaves(x,x)) over the fixed domain."""
    D = ['b', 'alice', 'bob']
    def val(a, b): return S.get((a, b), False)
    # Ground instance x='b': val('b','b') == (not val('b','b'))  → impossible
    return False
Example evaluation on a random Shaves/2 interpretation S: result = False

Reason why
----------
• We treat the domain and the axiom as static; the Shaves/2 interpretation S is dynamic.
• Domain D = ['b', 'alice', 'bob']
• Sentence: ∀x. Shaves(b,x) == (not Shaves(x,x))
• Unroll the universal quantifier over D and examine each ground instance:
•  - For x='b': instance is A == (not A) with A := Shaves(b,b) → contradiction.
•  - For x='alice': instance is Shaves(b,'alice') == (not Shaves('alice','alice')). (Constraint on S if we were searching for a model.)
•  - For x='bob': instance is Shaves(b,'bob') == (not Shaves('bob','bob')). (Constraint on S if we were searching for a model.)
• Conclusion at mix time: the sentence is unsatisfiable for any S; residual returns False.

Check (harness)
----------------
PASS: residual evaluator agrees with the generic evaluator on 800 random interpretations.
