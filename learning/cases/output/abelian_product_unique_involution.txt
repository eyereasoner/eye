ANSWER
========================================================================
Finite abelian G: the product of all elements equals e unless G has a unique
element t of order 2, in which case the product equals t.
========================================================================
REASON WHY
========================================================================
Pair-with-inverse argument in an abelian group G.
• Partition G \ T into pairs {g, g^{-1}} with g ≠ g^{-1}.
  Each pair multiplies to e, so they contribute e to the total product.
• What remains is the product over T = {x ∈ G : x = x^{-1}} = {x : 2x = 0},
  the 2-torsion subgroup. T is elementary abelian (every element has order 1 or 2).
• If |T| ≥ 4 (or |T|=1), elements of T can be paired to multiply to e; the total
  product over T is e. If |T|=2, then T={e,t} and the product over T is t.
Therefore the product over all of G is e unless there is a unique t of order 2,
in which case the product is t.

Concrete decomposition view.
Write G ≅ Z_{n1}×…×Z_{nk}. Then the 2-torsion size is 2^r, where r is the number
of even n_i (each contributes a coordinate 0 or n_i/2). Hence there is a unique
non-identity 2-torsion element iff exactly one n_i is even; in that case the product
of all elements equals that element (0,…,n_i/2,…,0).
