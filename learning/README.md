# EYE learning

EYE learning transforms raw **Data** (e.g., *RDF*), **Rules** (e.g., *N3*), and a well-defined **Goal** into **actionable insights**.  
It leverages a **LLM** (e.g., *GPT-5 Thinking*) as a **meta-compiler** to automatically synthesize a **self-contained Python program**.  
This program not only produces an **Answer** but also explains the **Reason why** and performs an independent **Check (harness)** to ensure correctness.

## Running the eye learning cases

Run the [eye learning cases](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye/tree/master/learning/cases) to get the [answer, reason why and check (harness)](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye/tree/master/learning/cases/output)
   ```bash
   ./test
   ```
