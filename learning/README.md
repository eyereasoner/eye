# EYE learning

EYE learning is a practical method for transforming **Data** (like RDF graphs), **Rules** (in Notation3/N3), and a specific **Goal** into actionable, verifiable insight. The approach uses a Large Language Model (LLM) as a *meta-compiler* to generate a **single, self-contained Python program**. This program is designed to be fully autonomous, delivering three key outputs:

1.  The final **Answer**.
2.  An explanation of the **Reason Why**.
3.  An independent **Check (harness)** that validates the result, guarding against errors and hallucinations.

See [A Guide to EYE Learning](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye/blob/master/learning/EYE-learning.md).

Run the [EYE learning cases](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye/tree/master/learning/cases) to get the [answer, reason why and check (harness)](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye/tree/master/learning/cases/output)
   ```bash
   ./test
   ```
