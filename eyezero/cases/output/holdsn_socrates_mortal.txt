Model
=====
Individuals D = ['Socrates', 'Plato', 'Zeus']

Signature
---------
• Holds₁(C, a): a ∈ extension of the class named by C (C is an *intension*).
• Holds₂(SubClassOf, P, Q): the class named P is included in the class named Q.

Named classes and base facts
----------------------------
- ex:Greek    : members = ['Socrates']
- ex:Human    : members = ['Plato', 'Socrates']
- ex:Mortal   : members = []
- ex:Immortal : members = ['Zeus']

Subclass rules
--------------
• Greek ⊆ Human, Human ⊆ Mortal

Question
========
Given facts Human(Socrates), Human(Plato), Greek(Socrates), Immortal(Zeus)
and rules Greek ⊆ Human and Human ⊆ Mortal:
(1) Is Socrates mortal?
(2) Which classes does Socrates belong to after closure?

Answer
======
Is Socrates mortal? Yes
Classes(Socrates) after closure = {ex:Greek, ex:Human, ex:Mortal}

Reason why
==========
We use a first-order core with named classes and two fixed predicates:
  • Holds₁(C,a) for membership, and Holds₂(SubClassOf,P,Q) for subclass.
From the rules Greek ⊆ Human and Human ⊆ Mortal, we infer Greek ⊆ Mortal by transitivity.
Since Greek(Socrates) (and also Human(Socrates)), subclass propagation yields Mortal(Socrates).

Kleene membership closure from base facts yields the ascending chain:
  ∅ ⊆ {ex:Greek(Socrates), ex:Human(Plato), ex:Human(Socrates), ex:Immortal(Zeus)} ⊆ {ex:Greek(Socrates), ex:Human(Plato), ex:Human(Socrates), ex:Immortal(Zeus), ex:Mortal(Plato), ex:Mortal(Socrates)} ⊆ {ex:Greek(Socrates), ex:Human(Plato), ex:Human(Socrates), ex:Immortal(Zeus), ex:Mortal(Plato), ex:Mortal(Socrates)}
which stabilizes at LFP = {ex:Greek(Socrates), ex:Human(Plato), ex:Human(Socrates), ex:Immortal(Zeus), ex:Mortal(Plato), ex:Mortal(Socrates)}.

Check (harness)
===============
PASS 1: SubClassOf contains Greek⊆Human and Human⊆Mortal.
PASS 2: Transitive subclass includes Greek⊆Mortal.
PASS 3: Kleene step 1 contains all base facts.
PASS 4: Chain is ascending and stabilizes.
PASS 5: Socrates is mortal is derived.
PASS 6: Plato is also inferred mortal.
PASS 7: Zeus is not inferred mortal (as intended).
PASS 8: Socrates classes after closure are {Greek, Human, Mortal}.
PASS 9: Deterministic formatting is stable.
PASS 10: Closure is idempotent (fixed point).
PASS 11: No out-of-vocabulary facts were created.
PASS 12: Total number of membership facts is exactly 6.
