Question
========
Do the fundamental laws of physics co-emerge and evolve with the universe (E_min)?

Answer
======
Yes.

Reason why
==========
Mathematical-English derivation:
Definition D (E_min): ∀x,  E(x) ⇐ [ R(x) ∧ ( H(x)+F(x)+¬U(x) ≥ 2 ) ].
Premise 1: R(World) is true because regime_count(World) = 3 ≥ 2.
Premise 2: H(World) is true (history dependence present).
Premise 3: F(World) is true (selection/feedback present).
Premise 4: ¬U(World) is true (timeless uniqueness is rejected).
Therefore among {H(World), F(World), ¬U(World)} we have 3 truths → condition (H+F+¬U ≥ 2) is met.
Therefore, by D, E(World) is true.
