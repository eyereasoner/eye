Question
========
Should we conceive reality as ordered/stratified and complementary (H_min)?

Answer
======
Yes.

Reason why
==========
Mathematical-English derivation:
Definition D (H_min): ∀x,  H(x) ⇐ [ L(x) ∧ Q(x) ∧ ( Cl(x)+Nr(x)+Co(x) ≥ 2 ) ].
Premise 1: L(World_H) is true because level_count(World_H) = 3 ≥ 2.
Premise 2: Q(World_H) is true (quantum contextuality present).
Premise 3: Cl(World_H) is true (classical-limit correspondence holds).
Premise 4: Nr(World_H) is true (nonreduction present).
Premise 5: Co(World_H) is true (cross-level coherence present).
Therefore among {Cl(World_H), Nr(World_H), Co(World_H)} we have 3 truths → condition (Cl+Nr+Co ≥ 2) is met.
Therefore, by D, H(World_H) is true.
