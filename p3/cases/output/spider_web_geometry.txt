# Answer
The most efficient geometric pattern is **logarithmic**, yielding the best ratio of web area to silk used.

# Reason Why (Deterministic geometric efficiency test)
- logarithmic: area=3.1416, silk=16.4413, efficiency=0.191080
-  quadratic: area=3.1416, silk=45.0819, efficiency=0.069686
-     linear: area=3.1416, silk=65.9734, efficiency=0.047619
Ranking (higher efficiency is better): logarithmic > quadratic > linear

# Check (Recompute deterministically to confirm stability)
-     linear: recheck efficiency=0.047619
-  quadratic: recheck efficiency=0.069686
- logarithmic: recheck efficiency=0.191080
