# P3

P3 is a goal-directed way to **teach an LLM like a student programmer**: you provide a prompt with goal, data, and logic as the “lesson plan,” and it learns to synthesize a single, self-contained Python program. That program is required to **show its work** via a triad of trust—Answer, Reason Why (explanation), and an independent Check (test harness)—so results are auditable and reproducible.

For the broader picture, see [A Guide to P3](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye/blob/master/p3/P3.md).

Run the [P3 cases](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye/tree/master/p3/cases) to get the
[answer, reason why and check (harness)](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye/tree/master/p3/cases/output)
   ```bash
   ./test
   ```
