What we currently use is a N3 sublanguage to express RDF-(star)-surfaces.
A negative surface containing a query surface is treated as a backward rule.
See for instance https://github.com/josd/eye/blob/master/reasoning/blogic/complex.n3

RDF-(star)-surfaces is in a sense all we need and we even have
coherent logic http://www.ii.uib.no/acl/description.pdf like in the example
