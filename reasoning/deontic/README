Deontic Logic example
---------------------

Conditional logic is an alternative to modal logic because it focuses 
on the truth of conditional statements ("if... then...") rather than 
general modalities such as necessity and possibility. While modal logic 
deals with abstract states or worlds, conditional logic investigates 
how certain statements can be true depending on specific conditions or 
antecedents. This makes it particularly well-suited to situations where 
context or causal connections are essential, such as in the philosophy 
of language, epistemology, and decision-making. It provides a flexible 
framework for reinterpreting modalities in terms of specific scenarios 
and dependencies.
