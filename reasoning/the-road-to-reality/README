The Road to Reality
-------------------

This P3-style N3 program builds a source-backed analysis of Roger Penrose’s book “The Road to Reality.”
Each source contributes simple (kind, value) claims—

    thesis (“comprehensive physics with deep mathematical foundations”),
    theme (“ambitious, math-heavy, challenging for general readers”),
    methods (“builds math first, then physics”; “twistor/geometry emphasis”),
    stance (“critical of string theory; argues quantum mechanics needs modification for gravity”),
    highlight (“over 1000 pages”),
    edition (“UK 2004 Jonathan Cape; US 2005 Knopf”).

A single Analysis node is created per book, and a facet is adopted only when at least two distinct
sources concur; those concurrences are captured as Support nodes and linked back as the Reason.

The Answer is that unique analysis object listing all adopted facets.

Independent Checks verify that every adopted facet has ≥2 sources, that the paired sources are distinct,
that all sources are dated on or after the publication year, and that the analysis status flag is
present—yielding a transparent, auditable summary whose threshold (e.g., require 3+ sources) can be
tuned by changing one rule.
