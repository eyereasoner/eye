Dairy Energy Balance
--------------------

This directory contains a single Notation3 file that encodes a toy case 
study about energy balance in dairy cows. Each cow is described by body 
weight, daily milk yield, the net energy density of the ration, and dry 
matter intake. The model computes a simple energy budget: a maintenance 
requirement proportional to body weight, an energy requirement for milk 
production proportional to milk yield, and an energy supply from the 
ration as intake multiplied by energy density. From these it derives 
each cow’s energy balance as supply minus requirement and the amount 
of milk that the ration could theoretically support if all energy above 
maintenance went into milk. Cows are classified as being in negative, 
near-neutral, or positive energy balance, and four examples represent 
an early-lactation cow in deficit, a mid-lactation cow roughly in 
balance, a late-lactation cow in surplus, and a grazing cow with a 
small deficit.

On top of this numeric core, an ARC layer derives an Answer node that 
summarises which cows are energy-deficient, near-balanced, or in 
surplus and how ration-supported milk compares to actual production, a 
Reason node that explains in mathematical English how the maintenance 
and milk energy formulas lead to these balances, and five Check nodes 
that confirm relationships such as “the early-lactation cow has the 
strongest negative balance” and “the late-lactation cow has the 
highest energy balance and a ration that could support more milk than 
she gives.” All of these ARC triples are computed from the same 
energy equations and input data, so if you change body weights, yields 
or ration parameters, the Answer, Reason and Checks update 
automatically, making the file a small, self-documenting example of 
dairy nutrition reasoning in N3.
