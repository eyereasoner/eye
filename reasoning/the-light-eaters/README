The Light Eaters
----------------

This P3-style N3 program builds a source-backed analysis of Zoë Schlanger’s book
“The Light Eaters.” Each source contributes simple (kind, value) claims—

    thesis (“plant intelligence reconsidered”),
    theme (“reportage plus science”),
    methods (“field reporting and recent research”),
    stance (“nuanced scientific debate”),
    highlight (“chemical signaling,
    memory-like cues”),
    recognition (“best-of-2024 lists”).

A point is adopted only when at least two distinct sources concur; those concurrences
are captured as Support nodes and become the Reason.

The program’s Answer is a compact analysis object on the book listing all adopted facets,
each linked back to its supporting evidence.

Independent Checks confirm that every adopted facet has ≥2 sources, that the paired
sources are distinct, and that all sources are dated on or after the publication
year—yielding a transparent, auditable, and tunable summary (e.g., raising the threshold
to 3+ sources requires changing one rule).
