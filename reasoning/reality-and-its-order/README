Reality and Its Order
---------------------

This P3-style N3 program builds a source-backed analysis of Werner Heisenberg’s book
“Reality and Its Order.” Each source contributes simple (kind, value) claims—

    thesis (“philosophical order of reality”),
    origin (“written 1941–42; privately circulated”),
    editors (“intro by Helmut Rechenberg; commentary by Ernst Peter Fischer”),
    translators (“Martin B. Rumscheidt, Nancy Lukens, Irene Heisenberg”),
    theme (“grand synthesis across science, humanities, and religion”),
    influence (“Goethean ordering”),
    edition (“English translation, Springer 2019”).

A single Analysis node is created per book, and a facet is adopted only when at least
two distinct sources concur; those concurrences are captured as Support nodes and linked
back as the Reason.

The Answer is that unique analysis object listing all adopted facets.

Independent Checks verify that every adopted facet has ≥2 sources, that the two sources
are actually distinct, and that all sources are dated on or after the publication
year—yielding a transparent, auditable summary you can tune by changing one rule
(e.g., requiring 3+ sources).
