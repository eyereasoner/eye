Multi-Agent Proofs
------------------

Multiple agents can work together by using their own knowledge/logic/data
and proofs made by other agents.

The proofs are guaranteeing a transparent and accountable way of working
and they only disclose what is relevant, so there is no need to have an
"All knowledge is contained in here" (what I learned from Tim Berners-Lee).

In this example agent1 and agent2 are GPS agents [1] and
agent2 reaches his goal thanks to the lemmata made by agent1.
