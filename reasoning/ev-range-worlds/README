EV Range Worlds
---------------

This directory contains a single Notation3 file that expresses a toy 
case study for electric-vehicle range estimation in four different 
“worlds”. Each trip is described by a distance, average speed, 
outside temperature, payload and battery size, together with a base 
energy consumption per kilometer. World W0 is a physics-flavoured 
reference model that adjusts consumption for speed (aerodynamic drag), 
low temperature and heavy payload; W1 is a naive rule-of-thumb world 
that only multiplies distance by an average consumption; W2 adds 
speed-awareness but still ignores temperature and payload; and W3 is a 
cautious world that takes W0’s estimate and adds a 30% safety buffer.

The core rules compute, for each trip and world, the energy required 
and classify the trip as either safeInWorld or riskyInWorld based on 
the available battery capacity. On top of this numeric core, an ARC 
layer derives an Answer node that summarises how the four worlds 
classify four example trips (from a short warm city errand to long, 
cold highway runs), a Reason node that explains why they disagree 
(which conditions they do or don’t take into account), and two Check 
nodes that confirm relationships such as “W3 is at least as cautious 
as W0 on these trips” and “W1 is the most optimistic on harsh 
highway scenarios”. All of these ARC triples are derived from the 
same trip and world facts, so if you change the inputs or the world 
formulas, the Answer, Reason and Checks will change accordingly. This 
makes the file a small, self-contained artifact that both performs 
real-world-flavoured reasoning about EV range and documents its own 
conclusions.
