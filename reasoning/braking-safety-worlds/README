Braking Safety Worlds
---------------------

This directory contains a single Notation3 file that expresses a toy 
case study for braking safety in road traffic scenarios. It models four 
“worlds” (W0–W3) that estimate how much distance a car needs to 
stop before hitting an obstacle, based on speed, road friction, and the 
available distance to brake. World W0 is a simple physics-based model 
that adds a one-second reaction distance to a friction-based braking 
distance; W1 is a stripped-down formula that ignores reaction time; W2 
naively assumes a dry-road friction coefficient for everyone, even on 
ice; and W3 is a cautious world that multiplies the physics-based 
stopping distance by a safety factor to build in extra margin.

Each scenario is a small real-world flavored situation (“city driving 
on dry asphalt”, “highway speed with a short gap”, “wet 
road”, “icy road”) encoded as speed, friction coefficient and 
available distance. From these, the core rules compute four different 
stopping distances and classify each scenario as either safeInWorld or 
riskyInWorld for worlds W0–W3. On top of this numeric core, an ARC 
layer derives a compact Answer node that summarises how the worlds 
agree and disagree on the four examples, a Reason node that explains 
why the differences arise (reaction time, friction assumptions, and 
safety factors), and a couple of Check nodes that confirm relationships 
such as “W2 is the most optimistic on ice” and “W3 is at least as 
cautious as W0” on the examples. All of these ARC triples are derived 
from the same scenario and world facts, so if you change the inputs or 
the world formulas, the Answer, Reason and Checks will update 
accordingly. This makes the file a small, self-contained artifact that 
both does real-world-flavored problem solving and documents its own 
conclusions.
