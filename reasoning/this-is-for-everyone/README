This Is for Everyone
--------------------

This P3-style N3 program builds a source-backed analysis of Tim Berners-Lee’s book "This Is for Everyone".
Each cited source contributes simple (kind, value) claims—

    thesis (“memoir plus call to action to redeem the web”),
    theme (“memoir + manifesto”),
    stance (“critiques platform dominance and data exploitation”),
    proposal (“Solid personal-data pods”),
    highlight (“gave the web away for free”),
    recognition (“Sunday Times bestseller”),
    edition (“UK 2025 Macmillan / US 2025 FSG”).

The rules first create exactly one Analysis node per book, then adopt a facet only when at least two
distinct sources concur; those concurrences are recorded as Support nodes and linked back as the Reason.

The Answer is that unique analysis object listing all adopted facets.

Independent Checks verify that every adopted facet has ≥2 sources, that the paired sources are indeed
distinct, that all sources are dated on or after the publication year, and that an analysis status
flag is present—yielding a transparent, auditable summary whose threshold (e.g., require 3+ sources)
can be tuned by adjusting one rule.
