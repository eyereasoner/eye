On the Origin of Time
---------------------

This P3-style N3 program builds a source-backed analysis of Thomas Hertog’s book
"On the Origin of Time". Each source contributes simple claims as (kind, value)
pairs—e.g.,

    thesis (“laws and time co-evolve”), 
    Darwinian framing,
    methods (holography, top-down cosmology),
    stance (challenges multiverse),
    theme (memoir + science),
    highlight (Hawking revised his view),
    testability (primordial gravitational waves).

A point is adopted only when at least two distinct sources concur; those
concurrences are recorded as Support nodes and become the Reason for the analysis.

The program’s Answer is a compact :analysis object on the book that lists all
adopted facets, each linked back to its supporting evidence.

Independent Checks verify that every adopted facet has ≥2 sources, that the two
sources are actually distinct, and that all sources are dated on or after the
book’s publication year—yielding a transparent, auditable summary whose thresholds
(e.g., requiring 3+ sources) can be tuned by adjusting one rule.
