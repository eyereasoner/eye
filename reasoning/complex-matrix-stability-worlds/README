Complex Matrix Stability Worlds
-------------------------------

This case is about how we decide whether a simple dynamic system is 
“safe” or “risky” over time. Each system is described by a tiny 
2×2 matrix that says how a state changes from one step to the 
next—whether it grows, shrinks, or oscillates. Using logic rules, we 
define when such a system is considered stable (it doesn’t blow up) 
or damped (it eventually dies out), and then we look at four different 
“worlds” or viewpoints: one uses the exact mathematics, and the 
others use faster, more approximate checks. By comparing how these 
worlds judge the same example systems, the case illustrates how 
different levels of approximation can lead to agreement or disagreement 
about stability, all expressed in a transparent, rule-based way.
