The Secret Lives of Numbers
---------------------------

This P3-style N3 program builds a source-backed analysis of book "The Secret Lives of Numbers"
(Kate Kitagawa & Timothy Revell). Each source contributes simple (kind, value) claims—

    thesis (“global history foregrounding unsung trailblazers”),
    stance (“challenges Eurocentric narratives”),
    theme (“accessible, engaging narrative”),
    highlight (“overlooked figures across cultures”),
    recognition (“2024 British Academy Book Prize shortlist”).

A single Analysis node is created per book, and a facet is adopted only when at least two distinct
sources concur; those concurrences are captured as Support nodes and linked back as the Reason.

The Answer is that unique analysis object listing all adopted facets.

Independent Checks verify that every adopted facet has ≥2 sources, that the paired sources are
distinct, that all sources are dated on or after the publication year, and that a status flag
shows the analysis node was created—yielding a transparent, auditable summary whose threshold
(e.g., require 3+ sources) can be tuned by changing one rule.
