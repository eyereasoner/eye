Reason why
==========
We model topic-level relevance explicitly via support(X, issue).
An argument is flagged only if it leans on at least one *salient, off-topic*
consideration and lacks *any* evidence that connects to the issue.
Thus a colorful aside does not trigger a flag when the argument also presents
relevant evidence (see Arg5).

Check (harness)
===============
Expected classifications hold? True
Arg1 clears after adding support(charity→privacy_regulation)? True
Arg3 clears after adding relevant evidence? True
Deterministic (same inputs ⇒ same result)? True

All checks passed? True
