Answer
======

=== Arg1
Text:        They say we should regulate emissions; but banning all cars is absurd!
Opponent:    regulate_emissions
Attacked:    ban_all_cars
Analysis:
  - attacks an OVERSTATEMENT of the claim: 'ban_all_cars' ⊃ 'regulate_emissions'
Result: STRAW MAN

=== Arg2
Text:        My opponent wants background checks; confiscating all guns violates rights!
Opponent:    background_checks
Attacked:    confiscate_all_guns
Analysis:
  - attacks an OVERSTATEMENT of the claim: 'confiscate_all_guns' ⊃ 'background_checks'
Result: STRAW MAN

=== Arg3
Text:        They propose trimming defense waste; abolishing the military is reckless!
Opponent:    cut_defense_waste
Attacked:    abolish_military
Analysis:
  - attacks an UNRELATED target: 'abolish_military' vs 'cut_defense_waste'
Result: STRAW MAN

=== Arg4
Text:        They want to raise property tax; here’s why that harms renters.
Opponent:    raise_property_tax
Attacked:    raise_property_tax
Analysis:
  - attacks the actual (or equivalent) claim
Result: no strawman detected

Summary
  Arg1: strawman
  Arg2: strawman
  Arg3: strawman
  Arg4: ok

Reason why
==========
We flag strawman when the attacked target differs from the opponent’s claim
AND is either a stronger/extreme version (overstatement) or off-topic.
Attacking an equivalent paraphrase, or the original claim itself, is not a strawman.
Examples:
  • Arg1/Arg2: stronger claims ('ban all cars', 'confiscate all guns') replace modest proposals.
  • Arg3: topic shift from 'cut waste' to 'abolish the military'.
  • Arg4: directly addresses the actual claim (no strawman).

Check (harness)
===============
Expected classifications hold? True
Arg1 clears when it attacks the actual claim? True
Arg2 clears when target is marked equivalent? True
Without relation evidence, Arg3 not flagged (conservative)? True
Deterministic (same inputs ⇒ same result)? True

All checks passed? True
