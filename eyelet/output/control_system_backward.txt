Step 01: prove control1(_,_) using clause 1
  ✓ measurement10(input1) = 2.236068
  ✓ measurement2(input2) = True
  ✓ measurement3 has disturbance1 = 35766
  computed c1 = 43.826932, c2 = 4.553470, command = 39.273462

Step 02: prove control1(_,_) using clause 2
  ✓ state3 = 22 , output2 = 24 , target2 = 29
  computed e=5, d=-2, c1=29.000000, n=1.460000, c2=-2.920000, command = 26.080000

Answer:  actuator1  command = 39.2735

Answer:  actuator2  command = 26.0800
