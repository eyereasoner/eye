# EYE Teaching ARC (Answer, Reason, and Check)

EYE Teaching ARC is a goal-directed way to **teach an LLM like a student programmer**: you provide a prompt with goal, data, and logic as the “lesson plan,” and it learns to synthesize a single, self-contained Python program. That program is required to **show its work** via a triad of trust—Answer, Reason Why (explanation), and an independent Check (test harness)—so results are auditable and reproducible.

For the broader picture, see [A Guide to EYE Teaching ARC](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye/blob/master/teaching/EYE-teaching.md).
