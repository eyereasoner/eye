Model
=====
Domain D = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Signature
---------
• Holds₁(S, x): x ∈ extension of the set named by S (S is an *intension*).
• Holds₂(op, S, x): x ∈ F_op(S), where op names a set-operator F_op: P(D)→P(D).
• Named binary relation ex:succ with extension {(x,y) | y = x+1 within D}.

Named subsets (for display)
---------------------------
- ex:N          : {0, 1, 2, 3, 4 — the whole domain
- ex:omegaAlias : {0, 1, 2, 3, 4 — alias of the whole domain (different name)
- ex:Evens      : {0, 2, 4 — even numbers
- ex:Odds       : {1, 3 — odd numbers
- ex:Prefix012  : {0, 1, 2 — prefix {0,1,2}
- ex:ZeroOnly   : {0 — singleton {0}
- ex:EmptySet   : ∅ — empty set

Named set-operators (intensions)
--------------------------------
- ex:F_closureFrom0       : F(S) = {0} ∪ succ(S)                  (monotone)
- ex:F_constPrefix012     : F(S) = {0,1,2}                        (monotone, constant)
- ex:F_evensOrSucc        : F(S) = Evens ∪ succ(S)                (monotone)
- ex:F_fromTopPred        : F(S) = {4} ∪ pred(S)                  (monotone)
- ex:F_toggle             : F(S) = D \ S                          (non-monotone)
- ex:F_weird              : F(S) = {0} if 1∈S else {1}            (non-monotone)

Question
========
For each *named* set-operator F: P(D)→P(D),
  (i) determine whether F is monotone;
  (ii) if monotone, compute its **least fixed point** LFP(F),
       and justify it by BOTH Kleene iteration from ∅ and Tarski’s characterization
       LFP(F) = ⋂{ S ⊆ D | F(S) ⊆ S }.
  (iii) if not monotone, exhibit a concrete S ⊆ T with F(S) ⊄ F(T),
        and describe the behavior of the Kleene chain from ∅.

Answer
======
- ex:F_closureFrom0: LFP(F) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- ex:F_constPrefix012: LFP(F) = {0, 1, 2
- ex:F_evensOrSucc: LFP(F) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- ex:F_fromTopPred: LFP(F) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- ex:F_toggle: Not monotone; witness S⊆T with F(S)⊄F(T): S=∅, T={0
- ex:F_weird: Not monotone; witness S⊆T with F(S)⊄F(T): S=∅, T={1

Reason why
==========
- ex:F_closureFrom0 is monotone, so by Tarski the least fixed point exists. Kleene iteration from ∅ produces the ascending chain:
  ∅ ⊆ {0} ⊆ {0, 1} ⊆ {0, 1, 2} ⊆ {0, 1, 2, 3} ⊆ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} ⊆ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
which stabilizes at {0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The Tarski intersection of all pre-fixed sets also yields {0, 1, 2, 3, 4; therefore LFP(F) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
- ex:F_constPrefix012 is monotone, so by Tarski the least fixed point exists. Kleene iteration from ∅ produces the ascending chain:
  ∅ ⊆ {0, 1, 2} ⊆ {0, 1, 2}
which stabilizes at {0, 1, 2. The Tarski intersection of all pre-fixed sets also yields {0, 1, 2; therefore LFP(F) = {0, 1, 2.
- ex:F_evensOrSucc is monotone, so by Tarski the least fixed point exists. Kleene iteration from ∅ produces the ascending chain:
  ∅ ⊆ {0, 2, 4} ⊆ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} ⊆ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
which stabilizes at {0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The Tarski intersection of all pre-fixed sets also yields {0, 1, 2, 3, 4; therefore LFP(F) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
- ex:F_fromTopPred is monotone, so by Tarski the least fixed point exists. Kleene iteration from ∅ produces the ascending chain:
  ∅ ⊆ {4} ⊆ {3, 4} ⊆ {2, 3, 4} ⊆ {1, 2, 3, 4} ⊆ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} ⊆ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
which stabilizes at {0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The Tarski intersection of all pre-fixed sets also yields {0, 1, 2, 3, 4; therefore LFP(F) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
- ex:F_toggle is not monotone: with S⊆T given by S=∅, T={0 we have F(S)={0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ⊄ F(T)={1, 2, 3, 4. The Kleene sequence from ∅ behaves as:
  ∅ ⊆ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} ⊆ ∅
(no guaranteed least fixed point).
- ex:F_weird is not monotone: with S⊆T given by S=∅, T={1 we have F(S)={1 ⊄ F(T)={0. The Kleene sequence from ∅ behaves as:
  ∅ ⊆ {1} ⊆ {0} ⊆ {1}
(no guaranteed least fixed point).
