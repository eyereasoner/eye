Question
========
Is physical reality fundamentally governed by deep mathematical structures (M_min)?

Answer
======
Yes.

Reason why
==========
Mathematical-English derivation:
Definition D (M_min): ∀x,  R(x) ⇐ [ L(x) ∧ S(x) ∧ ( C(x)+P(x)+E(x) ≥ 2 ) ].
Premise 1: L(World_Penrose) is true (mathematical lawfulness present).
Premise 2: S(World_Penrose) is true (structural principles central).
Premise 3: C(World_Penrose) is true (consilience present).
Premise 4: P(World_Penrose) is true (predictive success present).
Premise 5: E(World_Penrose) is true (elegance/compressibility present).
Therefore among {C(World_Penrose), P(World_Penrose), E(World_Penrose)} we have 3 truths → condition (C+P+E ≥ 2) is met.
Therefore, by D, R(World_Penrose) is true.
