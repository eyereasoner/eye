Question
========
Is every consistent, effectively axiomatized, sufficiently arithmetic theory incomplete (Gödel 1931, G1_min)?

Answer
======
Yes.

Reason why
==========
Mathematical-English derivation:
Definition D (G1_min): ∀T,  Inc(T) ⇐ [ EA(T) ∧ Cons(T) ∧ Arith(T) ].
Premise 1: EA(PA) is true (computably enumerable axioms).
Premise 2: Cons(PA) is true (no contradictions provable).
Premise 3: Arith(PA) is true (represents basic arithmetic).
Therefore, by D, Inc(PA) is true.

===============
[PASS] Null theory is not G1_min-true
[PASS] Boundary EA∧Cons∧Arith ⇒ Inc
[PASS] EA is necessary
[PASS] Consistency is necessary
[PASS] Arithmetic expressivity is necessary
[PASS] Monotonicity True→True under added evidence
[PASS] Idempotence of evaluation and proof tokens
[PASS] True ⇒ EA & Cons & Arith (exhaustive 2×2×2 grid)
[PASS] Inconsistent-but-complete theories fail G1_min
[PASS] Complete but non-effective Th(N) fails G1_min (EA False)
[PASS] Invariance to field order
