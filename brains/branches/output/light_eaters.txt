Question
========
Are plants intelligent (under the minimal criterion I_min)?

Answer
======
Yes.

Reason why
==========
Mathematical-English derivation:
Definition D (I_min): ∀x,  I(x) ⇐ [ S(x) ∧ G(x) ∧ ( M(x)+N(x)+C(x) ≥ 2 ) ].
Premise 1: S(Plants) is true because modalities_count(Plants) = 4 ≥ 2.
Premise 2: G(Plants) is true (goal-directed adaptation present).
Premise 3: Among {M(Plants), N(Plants), C(Plants)} we have 3 truths → condition (M+N+C ≥ 2) is met.
Therefore, by D, I(Plants) is true.

Check (harness)
===============
[PASS] Null system is not intelligent
[PASS] Boundary two-of-three with S & G holds
[PASS] Sensing (S) is necessary
[PASS] Monotonicity True→True under added evidence
[PASS] Idempotence of evaluation and core proof tokens
[PASS] True ⇒ S & G & two-of-three (exhaustive small grid)
[PASS] Minimality of necessary conditions
[PASS] Invariance to field order
