Model
=====
Individuals D = ['Sophroniscus', 'Socrates', 'Lamprocles', 'Ariston', 'Plato', 'Nicomachus', 'Aristotle']

Fixed predicates (signature)
----------------------------
• ex:holds2(R,x,y)   — application (⟨x,y⟩ ∈ ext(R)); sorts: (NAME, IND, IND)
• ex:SubRelOf(P,Q)   — inclusion over relation *names*; sorts: (NAME, NAME)
• ex:leq_strict / ex:leq   — ⊆* with/without reflex on names; sorts: (NAME, NAME)

Named relations (with facts)
----------------------------
FatherOf  = {⟨Ariston,Plato⟩, ⟨Nicomachus,Aristotle⟩, ⟨Socrates,Lamprocles⟩, ⟨Sophroniscus,Socrates⟩}
ParentOf  = same pairs (different name)
TeacherOf = {⟨Socrates,Plato⟩}
AncestorOf = derived only (no base facts)

Inclusions over names: FatherOf ⊆ ParentOf, ParentOf ⊆ AncestorOf

Question
========
Q1) List all (X,Y) with holds2(AncestorOf,X,Y).   [auto engine]
Q2) ∃R: holds2(R,Socrates,Lamprocles) ∧ leq(R,AncestorOf) ?  [auto engine]
Q3) ∀R,y: (leq(R,ParentOf) ∧ holds2(R,Socrates,y)) → holds2(AncestorOf,Socrates,y) ?  [auto engine]

Answer
======
Q1) Engine: bottomup → AncestorOf = {⟨Ariston,Plato⟩, ⟨Nicomachus,Aristotle⟩, ⟨Socrates,Lamprocles⟩, ⟨Sophroniscus,Lamprocles⟩, ⟨Sophroniscus,Socrates⟩}
Q2) Engine: topdown → Witness relation-names R = {AncestorOf, FatherOf, ParentOf}
Q3) Engine: mixed → Universal statement holds: Yes

Reason why
==========
• Engines are generic; this CASE supplies only facts, rules, and a signature.
• Top-down SLD does goal-directed proof search with standardize-apart.
• Bottom-up LFP derives all consequences; the signature safely grounds
  head-only variables (e.g., leq(P,P).) from NAME/IND domains.
• Auto-chooser sends enumerative AncestorOf(X,Y) to bottom-up;
  bound/ground queries go top-down.

Check (harness)
===============
PASS 1: Bottom-up AncestorOf enumeration is correct.
PASS 2: Top-down AncestorOf enumeration is correct.
PASS 3: Engines agree on existential witnesses.
PASS 4: Universal property verified.
PASS 5: TeacherOf does not entail AncestorOf.
PASS 6: No reflexive AncestorOf facts.
PASS 7: Engine chooser behaves as intended.
PASS 8: leq reflexivity holds.
PASS 9: leq_strict transitivity holds.
PASS 10: Standardize-apart avoids capture across proofs.
PASS 11: Bottom-up closure is stable.
PASS 12: Pretty printing deterministic.
