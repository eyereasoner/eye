Model
=====
Individuals D = ['Socrates', 'Plato', 'Aristotle', 'Zeus']

Signature
---------
• Holds₁(C, a): a ∈ extension of the class named by C (C is an *intension*).
• Holds₂(SubClassOf, P, Q): the class named P is included in the class named Q.

Named classes and base facts
----------------------------
- Greek       : members = ['Socrates']
- Philosopher : members = ['Plato', 'Socrates']
- Human       : members = ['Aristotle', 'Plato']
- Mortal      : members = []
- Olympian    : members = ['Zeus']

Subclass rules
--------------
• Greek ⊆ Human, Human ⊆ Mortal, Philosopher ⊆ Human

Question
========
(1) ∃P  [ P is a class-name ∧ P(Socrates) ∧ P ⊆ Mortal ] ?  (list witnesses)
(2) ∀P  [ (P ⊆ Human ∧ P(Socrates)) → Mortal(Socrates) ] ?
(3) What are the classes of Socrates after closure?

Answer
======
(1) Exists P ?  Yes
    Witnesses: {Greek, Human, Mortal, Philosopher}
(2) For all P ? Yes
(3) Classes(Socrates) = {Greek, Human, Mortal, Philosopher}

Reason why
==========
We treat predicates as *names* and mediate application with fixed predicates:
  • Holds₁(C,a) for membership, Holds₂(SubClassOf,P,Q) for subclass.
Subclass rules Greek⊆Human and Philosopher⊆Human, together with Human⊆Mortal,
yield (by transitivity) Greek⊆Mortal and Philosopher⊆Mortal. Since Greek(Socrates)
and Philosopher(Socrates), the existential (1) holds with witnesses {Greek, Philosopher}
(and also the trivial witness Mortal, since Mortal(Socrates) will hold in the closure).
For (2), whenever P⊆Human and P(Socrates), subclass propagation implies Mortal(Socrates).

Kleene membership closure from base facts yields the ascending chain:
  ∅ ⊆ {Greek(Socrates), Human(Aristotle), Human(Plato), Olympian(Zeus), Philosopher(Plato), Philosopher(Socrates)} ⊆ {Greek(Socrates), Human(Aristotle), Human(Plato), Human(Socrates), Mortal(Aristotle), Mortal(Plato), Mortal(Socrates), Olympian(Zeus), Philosopher(Plato), Philosopher(Socrates)} ⊆ {Greek(Socrates), Human(Aristotle), Human(Plato), Human(Socrates), Mortal(Aristotle), Mortal(Plato), Mortal(Socrates), Olympian(Zeus), Philosopher(Plato), Philosopher(Socrates)}
which stabilizes at LFP = {Greek(Socrates), Human(Aristotle), Human(Plato), Human(Socrates), Mortal(Aristotle), Mortal(Plato), Mortal(Socrates), Olympian(Zeus), Philosopher(Plato), Philosopher(Socrates)}.
