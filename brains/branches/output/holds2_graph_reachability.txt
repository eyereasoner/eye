Model
=====
Nodes D = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']

Signature
---------
• Holds₂(r, x, y): ⟨x,y⟩ ∈ extension of relation-name r (r is an *intension*).
• Named edge relation ex:edge with pairs {⟨A,B⟩, ⟨B,C⟩, ⟨C,D⟩}
• Operator F(R) = Id ∪ ex:edge ∪ (R ∘ ex:edge) (monotone).

Question
========
(1) Which nodes are reachable from A?
(2) Is D reachable from A?

Answer
======
ReachableFrom(A) = {A, B, C, D}
D reachable from A: Yes

Reason why
==========
Kleene iteration from ∅ with F(R) = Id ∪ E ∪ (R ∘ E) yields:
  ∅ ⊆ {⟨A,A⟩, ⟨A,B⟩, ⟨B,B⟩, ⟨B,C⟩, ⟨C,C⟩, ⟨C,D⟩, ⟨D,D⟩} ⊆ {⟨A,A⟩, ⟨A,B⟩, ⟨A,C⟩, ⟨B,B⟩, ⟨B,C⟩, ⟨B,D⟩, ⟨C,C⟩, ⟨C,D⟩, ⟨D,D⟩} ⊆ {⟨A,A⟩, ⟨A,B⟩, ⟨A,C⟩, ⟨A,D⟩, ⟨B,B⟩, ⟨B,C⟩, ⟨B,D⟩, ⟨C,C⟩, ⟨C,D⟩, ⟨D,D⟩} ⊆ {⟨A,A⟩, ⟨A,B⟩, ⟨A,C⟩, ⟨A,D⟩, ⟨B,B⟩, ⟨B,C⟩, ⟨B,D⟩, ⟨C,C⟩, ⟨C,D⟩, ⟨D,D⟩}
which stabilizes at LFP = {⟨A,A⟩, ⟨A,B⟩, ⟨A,C⟩, ⟨A,D⟩, ⟨B,B⟩, ⟨B,C⟩, ⟨B,D⟩, ⟨C,C⟩, ⟨C,D⟩, ⟨D,D⟩}.
A path witness is: A → B → C → D.

Check (harness)
===============

PASS 4: LFP contains Id and edges.
PASS 5: LFP is transitive.
PASS 6: ReachableFrom(A) = {A,B,C,D}.
PASS 7: D is reachable from A with path A→B→C→D.
PASS 8: Non-reachabilities are correct for the line graph.
PASS 9: Deterministic formatting is stable.
PASS 10: LFP minimality holds on the sampled family (∅, Id, Id∪E, LFP).
