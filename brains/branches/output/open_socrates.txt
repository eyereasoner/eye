Question
========
Should one lead a Socratic life (S_min)?

Answer
======
Yes.

Reason why
==========
Mathematical-English derivation:
Definition D (S_min): ∀x,  S(x) ⇐ [ D(x) ∧ E(x) ∧ H(x) ∧ ( R(x)+T(x)+Q(x) ≥ 2 ) ].
Premise 1: D(Example) is true (dialogic inquiry present).
Premise 2: E(Example) is true (self-examination present).
Premise 3: H(Example) is true (intellectual humility present).
Premise 4: R(Example) is true (refutation-openness present).
Premise 5: T(Example) is true (transformative willingness present).
Premise 6: Q(Example) is true (big-questions focus present).
Therefore among {R(Example), T(Example), Q(Example)} we have 3 truths → condition (R+T+Q ≥ 2) is met.
Therefore, by D, S(Example) is true.

Check (harness)
===============
[PASS] Null life is not S_min-true
[PASS] Boundary two-of-three with D,E,H holds
[PASS] Dialogic inquiry (D) is necessary
[PASS] Self-examination (E) is necessary
[PASS] Intellectual humility (H) is necessary
[PASS] Monotonicity True→True under added evidence
[PASS] Idempotence of evaluation and proof tokens
[PASS] True ⇒ D & E & H & (R+T+Q ≥ 2) (exhaustive small grid)
[PASS] Minimality of necessary conditions
[PASS] Two-of-three requirement enforced
