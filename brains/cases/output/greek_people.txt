Model
=====
Individuals D = ['Socrates', 'Plato', 'Aristotle', 'Zeus']

Fixed predicates (signature)
----------------------------
• ex:holds1(C,x)     — unary application; sorts: (NAME, IND)
• ex:SubClassOf(C,D) — inclusion over class *names*; sorts: (NAME, NAME)
• ex:leq_strict / ex:leq — transitive / reflexive-transitive closure on names

Class names (intensions)
------------------------
Greek, Philosopher, Human, Mortal, Olympian

Base facts
----------
Membership:
  Greek(Socrates)
  Philosopher(Socrates), Philosopher(Plato)
  Human(Plato), Human(Aristotle)
  Olympian(Zeus)
Subclass:
  Greek ⊆ Human, Philosopher ⊆ Human, Human ⊆ Mortal

Rules
-----
1) leq_strict(C,D) :- SubClassOf(C,D).
2) leq_strict(C,D) :- SubClassOf(C,E), leq_strict(E,D).
3) leq(C,C).
4) leq(C,D) :- leq_strict(C,D).
5) holds1(D,x) :- leq_strict(C,D), holds1(C,x).

These rules propagate membership along subclass chains. Intuitively,
if x is Greek or Philosopher, and Greek/Philosopher ⊆ Human ⊆ Mortal,
then x is Human and Mortal as well.

Question
========
Q1) ∃P: holds1(P,Socrates) ∧ leq(P,Mortal) ?  (witness class-names)        [auto engine]
Q2) ∀P: (leq(P,Human) ∧ holds1(P,Socrates)) → holds1(Mortal,Socrates) ?  [auto engine]
Q3) List all classes C with holds1(C,Socrates) after closure.             [auto engine]

Answer
======
Q1) Engine: bottomup → Witnesses P with leq(P,Mortal) and holds1(P,Socrates): {Greek, Human, Mortal, Philosopher}
Q2) Engine: mixed → ∀P ((P⊆Human ∧ P(Socrates)) ⇒ Mortal(Socrates)): Yes
Q3) Engine: bottomup → Classes C with holds1(C,Socrates): {Greek, Human, Mortal, Philosopher}

Reason why
==========
• Class symbols (Greek, Philosopher, Human, Mortal, Olympian) are **names**.
  Application is via holds1(C,x); subclassing is via SubClassOf(C,D) and its
  closure leq/leq_strict over names.
• From the base facts and subclass rules we get:
    Greek ⊆ Human ⊆ Mortal
    Philosopher ⊆ Human ⊆ Mortal
  so Greek(Socrates) and Philosopher(Socrates) imply Human(Socrates) and Mortal(Socrates).
• Q1 finds all class-names P such that P(Socrates) and P ⊆ Mortal; these include
  Greek, Philosopher, and Mortal itself.
• Q2 checks a universal over class-names P: any P that is a subclass of Human
  and that contains Socrates forces Mortal(Socrates). This follows because
  Human ⊆ Mortal, and membership lifts along subclass chains.
• Q3 simply enumerates all classes Socrates belongs to in the least fixed point,
  which are exactly Greek, Philosopher, Human, and Mortal.

Check (harness)
===============
PASS 1: Intended subclass rules present.
PASS 2: leq_strict includes Greek⊆Mortal and Philosopher⊆Mortal.
PASS 3: leq is reflexive on all class names.
PASS 4: leq(Human,Mortal) via closure.
PASS 5: Membership closure for holds1 is exactly the expected 10 facts.
PASS 6: Zeus is not inferred Mortal.
PASS 7: Socrates is Human and Mortal via subclass propagation.
PASS 8: Greek, Philosopher, Mortal are witnesses for Q1.
PASS 9: Universal property for subclasses of Human holds.
PASS 10: Classes(Socrates) = {Greek, Philosopher, Human, Mortal}.
PASS 11: Top-down and bottom-up agree for Socrates.
PASS 12: Bottom-up closure is stable and deterministic.
