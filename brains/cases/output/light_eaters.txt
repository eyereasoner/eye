Model
=====
Individuals D = ['Plants']  (tests will create temporary ones)

Fixed predicate (signature)
---------------------------
• ex:holds1(R,x)  — unary application; sorts: (NAME, IND)

Named capability relations (intensions)
---------------------------------------
S(x): multimodal sensing (≥2 modalities)
G(x): goal-directed adaptation
M(x): memory
N(x): networked signaling/integration
C(x): communication influencing other organisms

Two-of-three witnesses
----------------------
PairMN(x) :- M(x) ∧ N(x)
PairMC(x) :- M(x) ∧ C(x)
PairNC(x) :- N(x) ∧ C(x)
TwoOf(x)  :- PairMN(x) ∨ PairMC(x) ∨ PairNC(x)

Minimal intelligence
--------------------
Imin(x)   :- S(x) ∧ G(x) ∧ TwoOf(x)

Question
========
Q1) Are plants intelligent under I_min (Imin(Plants))?        [auto engine]
Q2) Which pair-witnesses {MN, MC, NC} hold for Plants?         [auto engine]
Q3) Necessity: does ¬S prevent Imin for a system with G and two-of-three? [auto]

Answer
======
Q1) Engine: topdown → Imin(Plants): Yes
Q2) Engine: topdown → Pair-witnesses for Plants: {MC, MN, NC}
Q3) Engine: topdown → Necessity (¬S ⇒ ¬Imin) holds: Yes

Reason why
==========
• By rules: Imin(x) :- S(x) ∧ G(x) ∧ TwoOf(x).
• For Plants we have facts S(Plants), G(Plants), and all of M,N,C are true,
  so at least one of PairMN/PairMC/PairNC holds; hence TwoOf(Plants).
• Therefore Imin(Plants) holds. The necessity test shows that without S,
  even with G and two-of-three, Imin does not follow under these rules.

Check (harness)
===============
PASS 1: Imin(Plants) holds.
PASS 2: All pair-witnesses hold for Plants.
PASS 3: Necessity of S verified.
PASS 4: Two-of-three boundary implies Imin.
PASS 5: Monotonicity True→True under added evidence.
PASS 6: Standardize-apart/idempotence stable.
PASS 7: Deterministic bottom-up output.
