Model
=====
Domain N = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]

Signature
---------
• Holds₁(S, x): x is in the extension of the set named by S (S is an intension).
  - Named set: ex:Prime (the primes up to 60).
• Holds₂(R, a, b): ⟨a,b⟩ is in the extension of relation-name R.
  - Named relation: ex:Divides (a divides b).

Factorization (deterministic)
------------------------------
• factor_smallest_first(n): repeated division by the least prime divisor.
• factor_largest_first(n):  repeated division by the greatest prime divisor.
Both yield the same canonical multiset of primes for each n ≥ 2.

Question
========
(1) What is the prime factorization of 360? Is it unique?
(2) On N∩{2,…,60}, does every n have a prime factorization, and is it unique (up to order)?

Answer
======
Prime factorization of 360: 2^3 · 3^2 · 5
Is it unique (up to order)? Yes
FTA on 2..60: existence and uniqueness hold? Yes

Reason why
==========
Existence (sketch).  Suppose there were a nonempty set S ⊆ ℕ of integers ≥2 having no
prime factorization. Let m be the least element of S. Since m is not prime, it has a
proper divisor d with 1 < d < m. By minimality, d has a prime factorization; so does
m/d; concatenating them yields one for m — a contradiction. Thus every n ≥ 2 factors.

Uniqueness (sketch via Euclid’s Lemma).  If a prime p divides a product ab, then p
divides a or p divides b. Using this, assume n ≥ 2 has two prime factorizations:
  n = p₁ p₂ ··· p_k = q₁ q₂ ··· q_m.  Since p₁ | (q₁···q_m), Euclid’s Lemma gives p₁ = q_j
for some j; cancel and repeat inductively. Eventually the multisets {p_i} and {q_j} match;
hence the factorization is unique up to order.

Example (360).  We compute two factorizations deterministically:
  - smallest-first: 2^3 · 3^2 · 5
  - largest-first:  2^3 · 3^2 · 5
By the lemma, the first prime on the left must occur on the right; cancel and continue —
the multisets coincide, so the factorization of 360 is unique up to order.
