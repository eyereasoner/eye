Model
=====
Domain D = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'Dave']

Signature
---------
• A fixed predicate ex:holds2(R,x,y) on objects R,x,y (first-order).
• For each relation-name R (an intension, e.g., a URI-like string),
  its extension EXT[R] ⊆ D×D determines where holds2(R,·,·) is true.

Named relations (intensions) with brief descriptions
----------------------------------------------------
- ex:equals          ( 4 pairs): identity on D.
  Sample: ⟨Alice,Alice⟩, ⟨Bob,Bob⟩, ⟨Carol,Carol⟩, ⟨Dave,Dave⟩
- ex:sameTeam        ( 6 pairs): equivalence: teams {Alice,Bob}, {Carol}, {Dave}.
  Sample: ⟨Alice,Alice⟩, ⟨Alice,Bob⟩, ⟨Bob,Alice⟩, ⟨Bob,Bob⟩, ⟨Carol,Carol⟩ …
- ex:coMember        ( 6 pairs): same extension as ex:sameTeam (different name).
  Sample: ⟨Alice,Alice⟩, ⟨Alice,Bob⟩, ⟨Bob,Alice⟩, ⟨Bob,Bob⟩, ⟨Carol,Carol⟩ …
- ex:coworker        ( 4 pairs): symmetric but not transitive.
  Sample: ⟨Alice,Bob⟩, ⟨Bob,Alice⟩, ⟨Bob,Carol⟩, ⟨Carol,Bob⟩
- ex:likes           ( 4 pairs): neither symmetric nor transitive in general.
  Sample: ⟨Alice,Bob⟩, ⟨Alice,Carol⟩, ⟨Bob,Alice⟩, ⟨Carol,Dave⟩
- ex:ancestorOf      ( 3 pairs): transitive but neither reflexive nor symmetric.
  Sample: ⟨Alice,Bob⟩, ⟨Alice,Carol⟩, ⟨Bob,Carol⟩
- ex:universalRel    (16 pairs): total relation D×D (an equivalence).
  Sample: ⟨Alice,Alice⟩, ⟨Alice,Bob⟩, ⟨Alice,Carol⟩, ⟨Alice,Dave⟩, ⟨Bob,Alice⟩ …
- ex:emptyRel        ( 0 pairs): empty relation ∅ (not an equivalence).

Question
========
Q1) Among the named relations R, which R are equivalence relations
    on D (reflexive, symmetric, transitive)? [meta classification]

Answer
======
Q1) Engine: meta → Equivalence relations on D are:
  - coMember (ex:coMember)
  - equals (ex:equals)
  - sameTeam (ex:sameTeam)
  - universalRel (ex:universalRel)

Reason why
==========
• Each relation-name R denotes a binary relation on D via holds₂(R,x,y).
  Properties Reflexive/Symmetric/Transitive/Equivalence are defined
  **extensionally** over this finite D.
• The classification:
    - equals, sameTeam, coMember, universalRel are equivalences;
    - coworker is symmetric but not transitive;
    - ancestorOf is transitive but not reflexive nor symmetric;
    - likes is neither symmetric nor transitive in general;
    - emptyRel is not reflexive.
• EyeZero’s bottom-up engine is fed the same holds₂ facts as EXT and the
  harness checks that both views coincide; all higher-level properties
  are then computed from this shared extension.

Check (harness)
===============
PASS 0: Bottom-up holds₂ facts exactly match extensional store.
PASS 1: ExtEq₂(sameTeam, coMember) and sameTeam ≠ coMember (intension ≠ extension).
PASS 2: equals has the identity extension on D.
PASS 3: Every r with Equivalence(r) is reflexive.
PASS 4: coworker is symmetric but not transitive.
PASS 5: ancestorOf is transitive, neither symmetric nor reflexive.
PASS 6: ExtEq₂ implies mutual SubsetEq for all pairs in scope.
PASS 7: universalRel is an equivalence on D.
PASS 8: emptyRel fails reflexivity and equivalence.
PASS 9: likes is not symmetric.
PASS 10: Set of equivalence relations matches expectation.
