Model
=====
Domain D = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]  (represented as strings in the logic)

Fixed predicates (signature)
----------------------------
• ex:holds2(R, x, y)  — binary application; sorts: (NAME, IND, IND)
   here R = ex:succ names the succ relation.
• ex:Reach(x)      — unary predicate for the least fixed point of F(S) = {0} ∪ succ(S).

Succ relation (as holds2 facts)
--------------------------------
succ = { (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) }

Horn program
------------
1) Reach(0).
2) Reach(y) :- Reach(x), holds2(ex:succ, x, y).

Semantics
---------
The bottom-up (least fixed-point) model of this program is exactly
the Kleene least fixed point of F(S) = {0} ∪ succ(S) on P(D).
Tarski’s theorem says this is the **smallest** S containing 0 and
closed under succ. The harness checks those properties explicitly.

Question
========
Q1) Enumerate all x with Reach(x).                      [auto engine]
Q2) Ground checks: Reach(0)? Reach(4)?                  [auto engine]
Q3) Is Reach the least set S⊆D with 0∈S and S succ-closed? [meta + engine]

Answer
======
Q1) Engine: bottomup → Reach = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
Q2) Engine: topdown/topdown → Reach(0): Yes, Reach(4): Yes
Q3) Engine: mixed → Reach is least succ-closed S with 0∈S: Yes

Reason why
==========
• The Horn program:
    Reach(0).
    Reach(y) :- Reach(x), succ(x,y).
  induces a monotone operator F on subsets S⊆D:
    F(S) = {0} ∪ { y | ∃x∈S . succ(x,y) }.
• EyeZero’s bottom-up semantics computes the least fixed point of F,
  i.e., the smallest S such that S = F(S). On this finite chain,
  the result is D = {0,1,2,3,4}.
• The harness checks the Tarski conditions:
    1) Reach contains 0 and is closed under succ,
    2) Any S⊆D that contains 0 and is succ-closed must contain Reach.
  Together, this confirms that Reach is the Tarski–Kleene least fixed
  point of F.

Check (harness)
===============
PASS 1: succ = {(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)} as expected.
PASS 2: bottom-up Reach enumeration = D.
PASS 3: top-down proves Reach(0) and Reach(4).
PASS 4: Reach is closed under succ.
PASS 5: 0 and 4 are in Reach.
PASS 6: Reach is subset of D.
PASS 7: Reach is the Tarski least fixed point of F(S) = {0} ∪ succ(S).
PASS 8: Reach computation deterministic.
