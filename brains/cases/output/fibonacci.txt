Model
=====
Indices n ∈ [0..12] (strings), Values v ∈ [0..144] (strings) for the demo range.
Large ground n (< 20000) answered by a one-shot oracle seed (fast doubling).

Fixed predicates (signature)
----------------------------
• ex:holds2(ex:Fib, n, v)  — Fibonacci as a binary relation; (NAME, IND, IND)
• ex:Succ(n,m)             — index successor (demo range); (IND, IND)
• ex:Add(x,y,z)            — precomputed addition (only Fib-values ≤ 144); (IND, IND, IND)

Program rules
-------------
1) Base: Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1.
2) Step: Fib(n+2) = Fib(n+1) + Fib(n) via Succ and Add.

Question
========
Q1) Enumerate all pairs holds2(Fib, n, v) for n=0..12.       [auto engine]
Q2) Ground checks: Fib(7)=13, Fib(12)=144?                   [auto engine]
Q3) Functional property: for each n there is a unique v.     [auto engine]
Q4) Large-N demo: query holds2(Fib, '3674', V).               [auto engine + oracle]

Answer
======
Q1) Engine: bottomup → Fib = {⟨0,0⟩, ⟨1,1⟩, ⟨2,1⟩, ⟨3,2⟩, ⟨4,3⟩, ⟨5,5⟩, ⟨6,8⟩, ⟨7,13⟩, ⟨8,21⟩, ⟨9,34⟩, ⟨10,55⟩, ⟨11,89⟩, ⟨12,144⟩}
Q2) Engine: mixed → Fib(7)=13: Yes,  Fib(12)=144: Yes
Q3) Engine: bottomup → Functional per n (unique v): Yes
Q4) Engine: topdown → Large-N (n=3674) solution present: Yes

Reason why
==========
• Names-as-intensions (ex:Fib) with fixed holds₂ keeps logic first-order.
• Add EDB contains ONLY sums of Fibonacci values ≤ 144 → tiny join space.
• Large ground N handled by a one-shot fast-doubling seed.
• Cached bottom-up facts avoid recomputing the LFP across checks.
