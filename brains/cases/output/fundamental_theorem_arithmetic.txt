=====
Domain N = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]

Named predicates & relations (intensional level)
-----------------------------------------------
• ex:Prime : the set of primes up to 60.
• ex:Divides  : the divides relation restricted to N×N.

Application predicates (first-order, EyeZero-style)
---------------------------------------------------
• ex:holds1(S,x) — x is in the extension of the set named S.
• ex:holds2(R,a,b) — ⟨a,b⟩ is in the extension of relation-name R.
  In particular:
    - ex:holds1(ex:Prime, n) ⇔ n is prime (for n in N).
    - ex:holds2(ex:Divides, a, b) ⇔ a divides b (for a,b in N).

Factorization (deterministic algorithms)
----------------------------------------
• factor_smallest_first(n): repeated division by the least prime divisor.
• factor_largest_first(n): repeated division by the greatest prime divisor.
Both yield the same canonical multiset of primes for each n ≥ 2.

Question
========
(Q1) What is the prime factorization of 360? Is it unique (up to order)?
(Q2) On N∩{2,…,60}, does every n have a prime factorization,
     and is that factorization unique up to order (finite-scope FTA)?

Answer
======
Q1) Engine: meta
    Prime factorization of 360: 2^3 · 3^2 · 5
    Is it unique (up to order)? Yes

Q2) Engine: meta
    FTA on 2..60: existence and uniqueness hold?
    Yes

Reason why
==========
Existence (sketch).
-------------------
Suppose there were a nonempty set S ⊆ ℕ of integers ≥ 2 that have no prime
factorization. Let m be the least element of S. Since m is not prime, it has a
proper divisor d with 1 < d < m. By minimality, d has a prime factorization;
so does m/d. Concatenating these factorizations yields one for m — a contradiction.
Thus every n ≥ 2 has a prime factorization.

Uniqueness (sketch via Euclid’s Lemma).
--------------------------------------
Euclid’s Lemma: If a prime p divides a product ab, then p divides a or p divides b.
Assume n ≥ 2 has two prime factorizations:
  n = p₁ p₂ ··· p_k = q₁ q₂ ··· q_m.
Since p₁ | (q₁···q_m), Euclid’s Lemma gives p₁ = q_j for some j; cancel p₁ on both
sides and repeat inductively. Eventually the multisets {p_i} and {q_j} match;
hence the factorization is unique up to order.

Example: n = 360.
------------------------
smallest-first: 2^3 · 3^2 · 5
largest-first : 2^3 · 3^2 · 5
By the lemma, the first prime on the left must occur on the right; cancel and
continue. The multisets coincide, so the factorization of 360 is unique up to
ordering of the prime factors.
