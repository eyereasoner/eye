# Answer • Reason • Check — *ARC*

ARC is a framework that transforms a combination of data, logic, and a question into a self-contained
program that not only gives an answer but also explains its reasoning and verifies its correctness.
Built on the [P3 method](p3.md), ARC embodies a “triad of trust” — Answer, Reason, Check — ensuring that
every result is transparent, auditable, and reproducible. By uniting generative AI’s creativity with the
rigor of symbolic reasoning, ARC produces explainable and verifiable outputs that can be confidently used
in real-world applications.
