# Answer • Reason • Check — *ARC*

ARC is a framework that transforms a combination of data, logic, and a question into a self-contained program that not only gives an answer but also explains its reasoning and verifies its correctness. Built on the [P3 method](p3.md), ARC embodies a “triad of trust” — Answer, Reason, Check — ensuring that every result is transparent, auditable, and reproducible. By uniting generative AI’s creativity with the rigor of symbolic reasoning, ARC produces explainable and verifiable outputs that can be confidently used in real-world applications.
