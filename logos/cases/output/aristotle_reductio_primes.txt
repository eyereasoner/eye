Conclusion: there are infinitely many prime numbers.

=================================================
Reason (Aristotelian apagogé / Euclid's reductio)
=================================================
Assume for contradiction the primes are finite: p1, p2, …, pk.
Form the Euclid number N = p1·p2·…·pk + 1.
For any listed prime pi, we have N ≡ 1 (mod pi), so pi ∤ N.
Hence no listed prime divides N. Either:
  • N is itself prime → a new prime; or
  • N is composite → its prime divisors are not in the list (still new).
Contradiction with finitude. Therefore, primes are infinite.
